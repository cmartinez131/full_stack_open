# Part 1

Familiarizing myself with react, javascript, component states, event handlers, and React useState hook by creating 
3 mini react apps.


**Courseinfo** is a single page React app that displays information about a course and its parts. The app consists of several components.

**Unicafe** is a single page React app allows users to give feedback and provides statistics on the feedback received, including the counts of different types of feedback, the total number of entries, average score, percentage of positive feedback, and a history of feedback entries. The statistics are stored in a table. It expands on the first app by making use of React **useState** hook.

**Anecdote**s is a single page React app which displays one anecdote at a time from a collection and allows the user to vote for their favorites. This app keeps a tally of votes using the React **useState** hook to maintain the state of an array, while JavaScript functions are used to generate random numbers
